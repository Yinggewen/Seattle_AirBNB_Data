Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique, personalized way. As part of the Airbnb Inside initiative, this dataset describes the listing activity of homestays in Seattle, WA. The dataset is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data).

The dataset has three data files:
* calendar: Listing id and the price and availability for that day 
* listings: Full descriptions and average review score 
* reviews: Unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
