Airbnb is a website for short-term house and apartment rentals. It allows the hosts to rent out their houses for a week while they are away, or rent out empty bedrooms. But they need to face the challenge to determine the price. So the important part I am trying to do is to find out a model to predict where prices lie and what features of Airbnb listings have the biggest impact on price.



From the above result we can understand that the prices depend on the listed features like accommodates, bathroom, people and number of bedrooms. It was also interesting to see how each of the review sub-categories correlated with each other.


Airbnb allows a guest to rate their experience of stay. We could perhaps gain an insight of what makes an enjoyable Airbnb experience. Using these factors, we can analyse how this is going to effect the pricing.
